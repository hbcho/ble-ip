- <strike>The description of active aheads is still vague. What is it that is exactly learned? (You may want to remove the term active aheads and replace it with something more generic to avoid saying too much about the company secret) </strike>
> I have included a explanation for that.

> above explanation should suffice
- <strike>Goal 1, second task: The metadata includes the beacon's location? Isn't that the central goal of the ANOLI? What is exactly the difference between the two tasks? </strike>
> So, the data would include other data like relative location, cluster details of the nodes, other sensors in the vicinity, added it to the pdf.
- Triangulation methods are not RSS based but TOF-based

- <strike>Why do you prefer 'Scene Analysis' rather than 'Fingerprinting'? </strike>
> feels its more accurate than fingerprinting. Personal preference I would say. If its inappropriate, please let me know.
- <strike>SMC filters are also Bayesian filters </strike>
> updated
- <strike>The title for Section 3.1.2 is 'Static Scene Analysis' but then you talk about Kalman filters and such. It would be good if you distinguished the two more clearly, e.g. write one paragraph about the static approach, then write one about the dynamic approach.</strike>
> Static scene analysis is nothing but fingerprinting, there is no dynamic scene analysis. Yes, dynamic filtering methods can be used for static scene analysis.
- <strike>Use abbreviations only sparingly; too many abbreviation make a text hard to read (e.g. NMM and MM are unnecessary abbreviations ---  you don't use them anywhere in the text except for where they are defined. Similarly, the many abbreviations in the introduction.) </strike>
> removed abbreviation in the introduction. I have used MM and NMM in the table. have space issues there.
- Remove the heading for Section 3.1 (there is no Section 3.2, hence not needed)
> then how do we put triangulation and static scene analysis as different paragraphs?
- Remove headings for Sections 4.1 and 4.1.1 (no Sections 4.2 and 4.1.2)
> same question as above.
- Remove heading for Section 5.1 (no Section 5.2)
> same question as above.
- My comments for Section 5 have not been addressed (there's a table and there's a list of experiments, but no description/putting them into context)
- <strike>In the experiment description, avoid sentences like 'We would like'. Be straight forward what the objectives are: 'Investigate the effect of user presence on the RSS values'</strike>
- There are still many incomplete references 
> Intentionally, left this due to lack of time. I have record of papers. I will use them in the thesis.
