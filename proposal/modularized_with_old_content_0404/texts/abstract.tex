\section{Abstract}
The thesis aims at getting a proof of concept for solutions to the \textbf{hybrid bluetooth low energy indoor positioning}(BLE-IP) along with \textbf{automatic node location identification}(ANOLI). ANOLI is mainly aimed during the calibration phase which gives out the locations of the bluetooth low energy(BLE) beacons. The BLE beacons are present inside the luminaires. The luminaires might either be installed in the ceiling or tethered to it. The location of BLE beacons determined using ANOLI and received signal strength indicator(RSSI) together are used in the BLE-IP task. The factors influencing the RSSI values is also studied and based on the target environment and accuracy the model is decided.  Simple applications like asset tracking is also implemented.
