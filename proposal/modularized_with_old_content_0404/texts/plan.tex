\section{Plan}


\subsection{Experiments:} 

\subsubsection{Data Analysis of RSSI values.} \label{exp-rssi}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Different Biases in RSSI measurements
\begin{itemize}
\item User's presence and without user's presence.
\item Different phones.
\item Different orientation of phones, angles, height? 
\item Different material of luminaires.(metal, plastic, metal+plastic). Its an added bonus if we can get the different luminaire material information from the BLE signal.
\item Different orientation of BT chip (cardinal directions and upwards and downwards)
\item Different calibration time for fingerprinting.
\item Different calibration points.
\item Fingerprint measuring while being still, only in 4 cardinal positions and while rotating.
\end{itemize}
\item With nearest node not working.
\item Experiment with different orientation of the mobile device. Hypothesis is that the there is 5 dBm difference for the change in orientation \cite{kaemar}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Methods} 
Next, based on the results of the experiments above implement the methods described in the \ref{methods}.

\section{Observations:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The signal strengths from the nodes
\end{enumerate}}
