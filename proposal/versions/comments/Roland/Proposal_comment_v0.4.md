- Section 5: There's a table and a list of items, but no text describing them. Also, you can remove Section 5.2, it carries no information.
- Re: 5.1: Yes, but what should we make about it? You need to describe what this list is for, as well as the table. A few sentences is enough, but if I just see the table (list), I don't know what to do with it.
- There are some language issues, but it's mostly good enough; for the thesis we'll have to make it perfect.
- Another thing: There's also always a space between words and references, i.e. "bla bla bla~\cite{ref}" rather than "bla bla bla\cite{ref}". Finally, don't start sentences with "So, [...]" or "And [...]", that gives it a colloquial feeling.
- Right, many references are wrongly cited. E.g.: "[19] Mazzullah Khan et al,2017" <-- No idea what article this is...
- Also, I would probably switch the order of the first and second paragraph in the introduction, i.e. first mention the general problem, then say what the challenges are.
- And you could probably remove the heading 1.1 and just have the setup as a new paragraph "In this thesis, the setup considered is as follows. BLE beacons are ..."
- Actually I would suggest the following:
> 1. Remove the last sentence from the third paragraph and start a new paragraph, something like this:

> > > "The aim of this thesis is to 1) develop an automatic BLE beacon localization algorithm and 2) develop an indoor positioning algorithm. The setup considered is ..."


- Finally, if you use terms like "Active Aheads", you need to describe them. I don't know what it is.
